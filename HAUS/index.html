                            <li>The Earth has changed since its beginning and continues to change today. Most of the changes on Earth happen over such a long period of time they cannot be observed. In this module students experience how the Earth has changed over time and learn about the clues that are used to identify those changes.</li><br>

Although they give shape to the surface of the Earth, over time the movement of wind and water causes these features to change. In this module, students discover how weathering and erosion change Earth’s features over time.</li><br>

                            <li>Over and over, the Moon changes phase, day turns to night and spring becomes summer. These cycles of change happen as the Earth spins on its axis while orbiting around the sun. This module introduces students to the different cycles observed on Earth.</li><br>
